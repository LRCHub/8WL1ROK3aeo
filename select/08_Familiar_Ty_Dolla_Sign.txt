That girl looked familiar
Real recognize real, that's familiar
I be ridin the whip that ain't familiar
Getting to the money, that's familiar
Ohhh that's familiar
That can't be yo girl, she familiar
If you ain't real we don't feel ya
Say my name to these hoes, that's familiar

Say my name to these hoes, that's familiar
My name in these streets, that's familiar
Got so many hoes I can't remember
Young rich nigga with a temper
Double cup full of Act, I be poured up
In the club, and my second chunk up
They know these hoes, they showin love
These ho niggas get no love
We goin up like every night
I fuck a bitch on every flight
But a bad bitch getting threesomes
I said OK, I'll marry ya
Yea, she know that I'm that nigga
And if they say yo name ain't that familiar?

Icy slopes, groupies on a boat, seen that before
Saint Laurent, mixin uniqlo, I know that ain't yo ho
Straight up
But goddamn it, I'm so outlandish
I'm beatin all my niggas, and that building so outstanding
Just Lil John cus he chasin what's familiar
Had no car and there come Scooby in that rental
Times are simple, now bitches comin andale, andale

I'm passin out state to state
Everyday my birthday
I'm pilin up, cake to cake
I'm a snort addict, whore addict
And I'm a porn star attraction
This feel like the all star game
That's Sylvester Stallone action
I need 2 Mrs. Jacksons
A full pack of Magnums
You ran a train, I ran er out
You took her took, we see you out
Goddamn!

I see that bitch everywhere, I swear that bitch see things
I seen that bitch somewhere, I think it was the Heat game
You know I peeped her feet game, she head up on them red things
She took me to the back
Introduced me to her head game
Can't trust these bitches
I swear these hoes familiar
She kiss you
But swallow all my children
I swear to God, these hoes be fuckin anyone
I swear to God, these hoes be fuckin anyone

Real shit, I ain't worried bout shit cus that money shit I chase it
Real shit,

Real shit, I ain't worried bout shit, in the club, getting wasted
Real shit, I ain't worried bout shit, I'm drinkin liquor, no chaser
