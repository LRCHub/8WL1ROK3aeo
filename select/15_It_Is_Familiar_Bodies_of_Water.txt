It was meant to be
There was something inside me
And the thing had to come out
When it left you
You rediscovered life
So what else could it have been for?

When you bend over into the fridge
And try to grab some tupperware
I'll surprise you and pour the half and half
Onto your newly sunburnt neck

It is familiar, oh the smell of the smell
Of your lotion, the wavy lines around your slick arms
I see my own hand moving out through the air
Coming soft down to rest upon your neck and hair

I heard something
I heard it said that you weren't
Quite the way that you turned out
You were tricked at some
Point and stopped becoming
The way that you've been all along

It is familiar, oh the smell of the smell
Of your lotion, the wavy lines around your slick arms
I see my own hand moving out through the air
Coming soft down to rest upon your neck and hair
