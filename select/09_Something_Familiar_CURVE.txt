A distant stare, I see myself there deep in the black
But can he see me of this, I'm not sure, it's just a feeling

And you know how those things have got me in trouble before
Yes, you know how those things have got me in trouble before

I thought I saw something familiar, I thought I saw something

He walks my walk and speaks my language, all at the same time

But he don't know the half of the hurt that he left behind
No, he don't know the half of the hurt that he left behind

I bet you saw something familiar, I bet you saw something familiar
I bet you saw something

Should I say where you been all my life
Should I say where you been all my life

Should I say where you been all my life
Should I say, should I say
Should I say, should I say

No, he don't know the half of the hurt that he left behind
No, he don't know the half of the hurt that he left behind

I thought I saw something familiar, I thought I saw something familiar
I thought I saw something familiar, I thought I saw something familiar
I thought I saw something
